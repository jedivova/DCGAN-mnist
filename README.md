# DCGAN 

A small PyTorch tutorial for DCGAN on MNIST dataset. The implementation primarily follows the paper: [Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf).

# Introduction

DCGAN with some hacks (explained in test_task.ipynb)
